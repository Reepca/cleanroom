Type "--output <filename>" to redirect the output to a file while running, 
or replace <filename> with "System.out" to redirect it back to the command 
line. Only actions relevant to the folder that the output is in should be 
done while writing to a file in that folder. All filenames are relative to the
directory that the program is launched from - for example, if you run 
ProxyProgram from cleanroom, and you want to write to log1 in 
networklogs/movement/ then you type "--output /networklogs/movement/log1".
